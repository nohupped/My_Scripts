This is a perl script for plotting MongoDB stats to collectd. 

Cpan Modules required: MongoDB

Packages required: libc6-dev

I wrote this script initially to monitor a replicaset using a different monitoring tool, which I modified again to suit the collectd needs, and to monitor a standalone mongodb node.
